# Network-Programming-with-Java
A repository to contain my programming assignments for Network Programming in Java.

TODO: Update this README to have better detail on what this repository holds.

## Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts
- Networking helps computers (any device that can connect to the web, really) communicate with one another in real-time.
- Addresses (IP, hardware) are unique identifiers that identify your system when connecting to the internet.
- There are several layers associated to a network. For a visual representation, Google "network layers".
- Ports are what allow specific network applications to get through, and deny service to closed ports.
- Ports 1-1023 are reserved for well-known services on a system. Ports usually after 1024 are fair game, and there are 65,535 ports.
- NAT
- Firewalls
- Proxy Servers
- IETF RFCs

## Chapter 2: Streams (I/O)
- Input and Output Streams

## Chapter 3: Threads
- Threads, multithreading, and different ways to utilize multithreading within applications.

## Chapter 4: Internet Addresses
- Summary of Chapter 4 here

## Chapter 5: URLs and URIs
- Summary of Chapter 5 here
