Create a file called logfile in a text file and put the line on page 137 in
the file 1000 times.

Then see if there's any difference in the timing.

Run programs in Example 4-10 and Examples 4-11 and 4-12.

Check the execution time between the two programs,
or check when the program started and when the program ended.

Change the number of the thread pool continuously to
see if there is better performance.

Get the difference between both programs.
